# quicksystemctl

Do you find yourself fiddling with systemctl a lot and getting the order of 
operations backwards since it is the opposite of that used for decades by the 
service command?

Do you find it annoying that systemctl is silent?  Did the daemon start?  Is 
there a problem?  Better run systemctl again with the status option to
find out...

This utility attempts to simplify the usage of systemctl for end users by 
creating distinct commands for the most common operations that one usually
performs.
