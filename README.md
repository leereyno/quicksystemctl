# quicksystemctl

Do you find yourself fiddling with systemctl a lot and getting the order of operations backwards since it is the opposite of that used for decades by the service command?

Do you find it annoying that systemctl is silent?  Did the daemon start?  Is there a problem?  Better run systemctl again with the status option to find out...

These scripts attempt to simplify the usage of systemctl for end users by creating distinct commands for the various operations that one usually performs with systemctl.
